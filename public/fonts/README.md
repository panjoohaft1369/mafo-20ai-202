# Shabnam Font Installation

## Instructions

1. Download the Shabnam font from: https://dl.fontfa.com/a-fonts/Shabnam.zip
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Copy these font files to this directory (`public/fonts/`):
   - `Shabnam.ttf` (Regular/400 weight)
   - `Shabnam-Medium.ttf` (Medium/500 weight)
   - `Shabnam-SemiBold.ttf` (SemiBold/600 weight)
   - `Shabnam-Bold.ttf` (Bold/700 weight)
   - `Shabnam-Black.ttf` (Black/800 weight)

## Current Setup

The `client/global.css` is already configured to use these font files with @font-face declarations.
The `tailwind.config.ts` is configured to use the "Shabnam" font family across the entire application.

Once you place the font files in this directory, the application will automatically load and use them.
